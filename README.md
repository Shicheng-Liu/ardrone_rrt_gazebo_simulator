ardrone_rrt_gazebo_simulator
=
This work is based on [tum_simulator](https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_simulator) and [ardrone_tutorials](https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials). In the _drone_controller_gazebo.py_, a client is added to receive pose data of the simulated ardrone from gazebo so that we can command the drone to move to assigned postion. If you are interested in rrt algorithm, you can watch the python code [here](https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_rrt)
